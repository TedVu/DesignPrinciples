# Single Responsibility

## Main Ideas

- A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

- Note that class in this context can be understood as software components/modules/microservices.

- This principle is really similar to cohesion principle.

- We don't want to change things because we don't want to retest software, conduct interaction testing.
